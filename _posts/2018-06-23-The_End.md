HELLO, WORLD!

To celebrate the recent end of my Undergraduate Studies in Statistics.

I Will change directions and focus on a new field =).
Well not entirely new but it's time to go beyond
just coding during summer and winter breaks.
The time has come for me to move my full focus,
towards becoming a Professional Programmer.

To celebrae I will say Hello World in all the languages I have learned in the past 2 years,
to celebrate the move.

From the first language I learned to the last

### c++

The first language I was introduced to was c++ my Junior year,
from there I became hooked on programming and almost switched majors..
side note pointer arithmetic was hard...

{% highlight c++ %}
#include <iostream>
int main()
{
    std::cout<<"Hello, World!";
    return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}

### lua

Decided to take a class in app development a semester later using Lua
and the Corona SDK. It was much easier than c++ for example

```lua
io.write("Hello, World")
```

### java

Also decided to take Java during this semester to learn more about object
oriented programming

{% highlight java %}
public class HelloWorld
{
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      System.out.println("Hello World!");
   }
}
{% endhighlight %}


### javascript

While learning html I touched on Javascript!! and that was weird for a While
oh the Promises (pun alert)

```javascript
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

#### python

Now the language I use the most for web development and writing scripts also
for statistical analysis during my senior year =).

{% highlight python %}

print("Hello World")

{% endhighlight %}
### r

{% highlight r %}
hello <- "Hello, World!"
   print (hello)
{% endhighlight %}

But wait there's more!...

Anymore at this point in my life would not have value,

until I dive deeper into the ones I currently know While

getting a better understanding of the

software engineering field

So Stay tuned and Get ready for some fun =).
